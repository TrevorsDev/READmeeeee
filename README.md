## Discription

This easy to use application allows one to generate a README file for ones project right from the command line. 

## Usage

By opening up a terminal through the index.js file, a series of questions will be asked. The responses will be generated into sections that form a professional README. To run the Generate README application, right click on the index.js file in VS Code and select the "Open in Integrated Terminal" option. Then, in the terminal, type and run "node index.js". This will run the program and allow you to answer the questions as they appear. Once finished, a "generated Readme" file will be created that looks professional and will suffice for all of your projects.

## Tests

Any tests that were run, were ran in the same fassion as described above under the "Usage" section.

## Contributors
